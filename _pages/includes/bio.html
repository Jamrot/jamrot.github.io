<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Junming Liu (刘君茗). I am currently a Master's student in <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn">Zhejiang University</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/wangweihai">Prof. Wenhai Wang</a>. My research interests in <strong>Large Language Models for Software Security</strong>, <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, and <strong>Program Analysis</strong>. </p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(194, 106, 55);">I am actively seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2025.</span></strong></p>

<p>My research interests focuses on improving the effectiveness and quality of the entire vulnerability management lifecycle, with two key aspects: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Advancing vulnerability management technologies, including vulnerability detection, automated fixing, patch correctness assessment, and more. </li>
  <li>Understanding the broader societal and community impacts of vulnerabilities. </li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve these goals, I am interested in exploring the use of machine learning, static analysis, and other techniques to enhance vulnerability management. I also seek to assess how these tools can improve both technical efficiency and the human-centered understanding of vulnerabilities.</p>

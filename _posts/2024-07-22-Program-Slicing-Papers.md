# Slicing Technique

## Survey
- On the Effects of Program Slicing for Vulnerability Detection during Code Inspection: Extended Abstract. ``ICSE-Companion`` [[paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3639478.3643117)
*1) slicing helps in finding some lines related to the vulnerability, 2) once 'some' correct lines have been identified, slicing makes no significant difference in the number of correctly identified fragments.*

## DL-based Slicing
- A Learning-Based Approach to Static Program Slicing. ``OOPSLA 2024`` [[paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649814)
*use a pre-trained language model to understand the variable-statement relationship, and predict the forward/backword propability of each statement, then construct the slicing.*

## LLM Slicing
- Revealing the Unseen: AI Chain on LLMs for Predicting Implicit Data Flows to Generate Data Flow Graphs in Dynamically-Typed Code. ``TOSEM 2024`` [[paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3672458) [[code]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1pwDEPK1yod6E9recAuIkntCL0oUXOV/view?usp=drive_link)
*use LLM directly slice python program to aid implicit data flow prediction.*

- Program Slicing in the Era of Large Language Models. ``arXiv 2024`` [[paper]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12369)
*following the work of DL-based Slicing (i.e., A Learning-Based Approach to Static Program Slicing), compare LLMs' slicing capability on Java with static and dynamic slicing tools, and find the main challenge is complex control flow.*

## Program Reduction
- LPR: Large Language Models-Aided Program Reduction. ``ISSTA 2024`` [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13064)
*evaluation: reduction size, time consumed, ablation.*

# Slicing Technique

## DL-based Slicing
A Learning-Based Approach to Static Program Slicing. ``OOPSLA 2024`` [[paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649814)
*use a pre-trained language model to understand the variable-statement relationship, and predict the forward/backword propability of each statement, then construct the slicing.*

# Applications

## Vulnerability Detection

### Machine Learning

üåü Learning Program Semantics for Vulnerability Detection via Vulnerability-Specific Inter-procedural Slicing. ``ESEC/FSE 2023`` [[paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3611643.3616351) 
*inter-procedural, slicing strategy (criterion, direction, graph) decided by vulnerability types.*

VulChecker: Graph-based Vulnerability Localization in Source Code. ``USENIX Security 2023`` [[paper]](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/mirsky) 
*backward slicing on PDG until pre-defined depth, criterion decided by vulnerability types.*

### Recurring Bug

üåü MVP: Detecting Vulnerabilities using Patch-Enhanced Vulnerability Signatures. ``USENIX Security 2020`` [[paper]](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/xiao)
*function-level backward+customized forward slicing on PDG based on changed statements, forward slicing graph decided by the changed statement.*

Detecting API Post-Handling Bugs Using Code and Description in Patches. ``USENIX Security 2023`` [[paper]](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/lin)
*function-level backward slicing on PDG based on post-operation statement.*

### Fuzzing

SFuzz: Slice-based Fuzzing for Real-Time Operating Systems. ``CCS 2022`` [[paper]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3548606.3559367) 
*binary, forward slicing from source points on call graph (based on data flow) to sink points.*

BEACON: Directed Grey-Box Fuzzing with Provable Path Pruning. ``Oakland 2022`` [[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9833751/)
*‚Äúperform a reachability analysis on the inter-procedural control flow graph and slice away paths that apparently cannot reach any target.‚Äù*

## Security Patch Identification

üåü GraphSPD: Graph-Based Security Patch Detection with Enriched Code Semantics. ``Oakland 2023`` [[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10179479) [[website]](https://sunlab-gmu.github.io/GraphSPD/) [[code]](https://github.com/SunLab-GMU/GraphSPD)
*function-level bidirectional slicing on PDG based on deleted/added statements.*

CoLeFunDa: Explainable Silent Vulnerability Fix Identification. ``ICSE 2023`` [[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10172826)

## Type Inference

DLInfer: Deep Learning with Static Slicing for Python Type Inference. ``ICSE 2023`` [[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10172544) [[code]](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7575544)
*slicing on DFG (def-use) based on given variable.*

## Data Augmentation

CoLeFunDa: Explainable Silent Vulnerability Fix Identification. ``ICSE 2023`` [[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10172826)
*data augmentation for silent fix detection (security patch identification), CWE classification and exploitability rating classification*
*function-level bidirectional slicing on CFG & DFG based on changed statements.*

## Vulnerability Type

VulChecker: Graph-based Vulnerability Localization in Source Code. ``USENIX Security 2023`` [[paper]](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/mirsky) 
*backward slicing on PDG until pre-defined depth, criterion decided by vulnerability types.*

- Integer Overflow: "call to a function that passes integer arguments"
- Stack & Heap Overflow: "store instructions to local or dynamically allocated memory"
- UAF: "memory accesses to dynamically allocated memory"
- DF: "calls to the memory manager's free function"
